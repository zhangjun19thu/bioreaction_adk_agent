The study found that DJ-1 positively regulates SAHH activity. Overexpression of wild-type DJ-1 increased SAHH activity, while DJ-1 knockdown or knockout decreased it.

The sample was redox-poised to maximize the concentration of the semiquinone intermediate for EPR and HYSCORE analysis. Key findings include: 1) DMSKD binds in a strongly asymmetric manner via a short hydrogen bond (~1.7 Å) between its O1 carbonyl oxygen and the Nδ of the heme bD axial ligand His66. 2) The isoprenyl side chain of DMSKD adopts a near in-plane orientation relative to the aromatic ring (C2C3CβCγ dihedral angle γ ≈ ±10°), which differs by ~90° from the perpendicular orientation observed for menasemiquinone (MSKD). 3) This conformation is selected and stabilized by the protein environment of the QD site. 4) The binding of DMK to the QD site causes a downshift of the two-electron midpoint potential by at least 30 mV compared to the unbound species, indicating a ~10-fold tighter binding of the oxidized quinone form (DMK) over the quinol form (DMKH2)."

PMID32340322,reaction_1,3-mercaptopyruvate -> Pyruvate + H2S,Not specified,"This study investigates the role of endogenous 3-MST in human fibroblasts from healthy controls (CC) and individuals with Down syndrome (DSC). DSC show approximately 50% higher 3-MST protein expression, which is primarily localized in the mitochondria. Consequently, DSC exhibit higher basal levels of H2S, measured by fluorescent probes AzMC and P3. Pharmacological inhibition of 3-MST with HMPSNE (1, 3, and 10 µM) normalizes H2S levels, restores suppressed mitochondrial respiration (basal, maximal, and ATP-linked OCR), and increases the reduced cell proliferation rate in DSC. In contrast, HMPSNE slightly reduces proliferation in CC and has no significant effect on their mitochondrial bioenergetics."

PMID32464091,reaction_2,t3CLC + DnaB + DnaGC <=> t3CLC-DnaB-DnaGC complex,Yes,The binding of DnaGC (primase domain) to DnaB triggers a conformational switch that increases the affinity of DnaB for the CLC by approximately 500-fold. Stoichiometry analysis indicates that only a single tau subunit within the CLC is responsible for binding the DnaB helicase.

PMID32464091,reaction_5,rolling-circle DNA + dNTPs -> extended leading strand,No,This experiment used a DnaB-DnaGC cross-linked construct to show that DnaB remains an active helicase even when permanently associated with three DnaGC domains. This argues that the interaction with primase does not inherently stall the helicase.
PMID32464091,reaction_6,Pol III*(solution) + Replisome(at fork) <=> Pol III*(at fork) + Replisome(at fork),Yes,This single-molecule experiment demonstrates that the concentration of DnaG primase directly controls the number of Pol III* polymerases associated with the replication fork and slows their rate of exchange. This is mediated by the primase-induced conformational switch in the DnaB helicase.

This suggests DGK2 (AGI: At5g63770) and the functionally redundant DGK4 (AGI: At5g57690) produce these PA species for pollen growth. DGK2 is suggested to have a predominant function over DGK4 in this process.

The transport assay with the fluorescent substrate AMCA was performed to validate the functionality of the engineered protein variants. The smFRET experiments revealed that DtpA exists as a dynamic ensemble of states. In LMNG detergent, it samples an inward-open (low-FRET, E=0.48) and an occluded (high-FRET, E=0.89) state, which interconvert with a relaxation time of ~1 ms. In lipid nanodiscs (e.g., POPE), DtpA also samples an outward-open state, showing cooperativity between the periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides which is lost in detergent. The conformational equilibrium was found to be sensitive to the lipid headgroup chemistry, with anionic lipids (POPS, POPA) promoting a novel, extremely inward-open state (E=0.25).

PMID33113038,reaction_1,ClO2- -> Cl- + O2,Not specified,"The primary finding of the paper is the photosensitivity of AoCld. The reported specific activity is for the non-illuminated enzyme, which serves as a baseline. Illumination with a high-intensity xenon arc lamp, as used in stopped-flow spectroscopy, leads to rapid enzyme inactivation. This process involves initial spectral changes (Soret peak redshift from 391 nm to 409 nm), followed by a biphasic loss of the Soret absorbance and specific activity (half-lives of ~3 min and ~50 min). EPR and SEC analysis showed that illumination causes release of the heme cofactor, release of ferric iron, and dissociation of the native pentameric oligomer into monomers and dimers, eventually leading to protein precipitation. The photoinactivation process itself was observed to be substrate-independent and was modeled as a first-order process with a rate constant of approximately 1.8e-2 s-1 for the initial spectral change."
